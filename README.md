# ZeesHUD Edited
The (in)famous TF2 HUD that looks like Persona 5's UI made by [Zeesastrous](https://github.com/Zeesastrous) and updated by rafaderren.

This version aims to fix issues that ZeesHUD have and add new features (when i feel like it)

Also includes [optional speed-o-meter](https://www.teamfortress.tv/61625/speedometer-in-any-hud)

I'm not a hud developer I'm just doing this because I love this hud :)

THIS HUD WAS TESTED IN 1366x768
